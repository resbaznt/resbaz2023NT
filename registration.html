Accessibility bursaries available
</h4></b><br><br><h6>
The cost of living is making life very tough right now. We don't want anyone to miss out on ResBaz because of financial concerns, so <a href="https://cdunilibrary.github.io/resbaz2023NT/partners/">thanks to our generous sponsors </a> we can offer support if you are worried about the cost of attending ResBaz. <br><br>

If you have concerns about childcare, travel or other accessibility expenses, please contact us at <a href="joanna.dziedzic@cdu.edu.au" target="_blank">joanna.dziedzic@cdu.edu.au</a> to ask about our Accessibility Bursaries. We're also offering free registration to volunteers, so get in touch <a href=" mailto:joanna.dziedzic@cdu.edu.au " target="_blank">joanna.dziedzic@cdu.edu.au</a> if you're keen to help out. <br><br></h6>
