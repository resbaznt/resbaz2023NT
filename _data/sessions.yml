  description: "Gale Digital Scholar Lab, developed with participation from beta testers across a wide range of institutions and organisations, is designed to transform the way scholars and students access and analyse Gale primary source materials by offering solutions to some of the most common challenges facing researchers in the digital humanities today. The Gale Digital Scholar Lab was officially released in 2018 and has continued to grow in popularity with Academics and Institutions across the world. . By integrating an unmatched depth and breadth of digital primary source matter with the most popular DH tools, Gale Digital Scholar Lab provides a new lens to explore history and empowers researchers to generate world-altering conclusions and outcomes. Through advanced humanities computing tools that make natural language processing (NLP) for historical texts accessible, more efficient, and impactful, the footprint of digital humanities can be expanded to more classrooms around the globe. 
<br>Researching primary sources & text and data mining have become more intuitive and easier to access without having the prerequisite skills in digital humanities.  This presentation will provide an introductory overview of the Gale Digital Scholar Lab, exploring the tools and functionality recently added for a better user experience.  We will explore how Students/Academics/ Researchers, and Librarians can use the Gale Digital Scholar Lab to search through their institution's primary source holdings from Gale or upload their own content to build their content sets using articles from various historical newspapers, analyse this content using the TDM tools available in the Lab and finally export the visualisations from the Lab.

We can gain and share expertise, learn more, and challenge ourselves to improve. Then, why don't we apply the same guidelines of efficient collaboration to writing analysis code? Collaboration is a strategy in which multiple people work together to accomplish a particular goal; the best is that it can be applied to everything we do. Has the thought of 'cross fertilisation between industry and academia' crossed your mind? One of the ground rules of industry development teams is to 'not work alone'. In academia, we tend to work in silos or be solo drivers. In this talk, I will go through the benefits of collaborative coding and show examples of how it would help your research and give you a competitive advantage in the future. "

This workshop will focus on improving your computational skills by showing you how the statistical program R can be used for data analysis and visualisation in Ecology.  <br><br>The course starts with some basic information about the R syntax, the RStudio interface, and moves through how to import CSV files. We will also show you the structure of data frames, how to deal with factors and how to add/remove rows and columns. By the end of the workshop participants will have an overview of how to run their R code in the EcoCommons cloud environment and how to use the R package {tidyverse} to manipulate and visualise their data. In particular, we will demonstrate how to use the functions ‘select’ and ‘filter’ to manipulate your data and how to use the ‘pipe operator’ for more complex data manipulation in combination with ‘summarise’, ‘group_by’ and ‘count’ for quick summary statistics. At the end, we will show you how to visualise your data using different plots in the R package {ggplot2}. <br><br>This workshop is suitable for early career researchers, undergraduates and ecologists who have a keen interest to learn how to code in R while harnessing the power of cloud computing to solve environmental challenges. This course is very suitable for researchers, students and practitioners who have no or little R experience and coding skills and have the desire to learn how to use code within the cloud-computing resources of EcoCommons. It is also well suited for people who would like to refresh their coding skills in R. <br><br>This workshop is based on the Carperntries course: https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/  <br><br>This workshop is brought to you by EcoCommons Australia.

  title: "Phylogenomics analysis using large-scale public genome data"
  description: "A 90 minutes workshop will be held for the phylogenomics analysis on large-scale whole genome data. We will lead participants through a series of computational exercises having the following goals: <br><br>- NCBI genome database download (SRA toolkit) and basic Linux command line (wget download). <br><br>- Construct orthologous gene assignments using OrthoFinder. <br><br>- Display, annotate and visualize phylogenetics trees by using iTOL (Interactive Tree Of Life) <br><br>Participants are encouraged to work with their own NGS-based genome/transcriptome datasets, but sample datasets will also be provided and analyzed.

  title: "Building a blog with git, R and quarto"
  description: "Grassroots communities of practice are a great way to build communities and skill share – creating an online presence and repository for knowledge, tutorials, and code can be a useful tool. We will introduce a workflow using Git, R, and quarto to run a community of practice blog by forking a GitHub repository, creating a blogpost in RStudio, and pushing the post back to GitHub. This workshop will feature the UQ Geospatial Analysis Community Group and use their R blog as an example. Basic understanding of Git + GitHub and R + RStudio is helpful but the workshop will be aimed at beginners with no prior knowledge."
