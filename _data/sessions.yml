In a similar vein, what a group of people search for reveals something about the group. <br><br>The Digital Collections Catalyst 2021 transformed more than ten years of State Library of Queensland catalogue search terms and created an interactive landscape based on the language, themes, subjects, and terms involved. <br><br>The result is a dynamic tool that helps us to understand what, when and how our users are searching the catalogue, and showcases the benefits of supporting developers and creatives to use our digital collections and collections data in highly creative and experimental ways.  <br><br>https://www.slq.qld.gov.au/digitalcatalyst"

  description: "Gale Digital Scholar Lab, developed with participation from beta testers across a wide range of institutions and organisations, is designed to transform the way scholars and students access and analyse Gale primary source materials by offering solutions to some of the most common challenges facing researchers in the digital humanities today. The Gale Digital Scholar Lab was officially released in 2018 and has continued to grow in popularity with Academics and Institutions across the world. . By integrating an unmatched depth and breadth of digital primary source matter with the most popular DH tools, Gale Digital Scholar Lab provides a new lens to explore history and empowers researchers to generate world-altering conclusions and outcomes. Through advanced humanities computing tools that make natural language processing (NLP) for historical texts accessible, more efficient, and impactful, the footprint of digital humanities can be expanded to more classrooms around the globe. 
 Researching primary sources & text and data mining have become more intuitive and easier to access without having the prerequisite skills in digital humanities.  This presentation will provide an introductory overview of the Gale Digital Scholar Lab, exploring the tools and functionality recently added for a better user experience.  We will explore how Students/Academics/ Researchers, and Librarians can use the Gale Digital Scholar Lab to search through their institution's primary source holdings from Gale or upload their own content to build their content sets using articles from various historical newspapers, analyse this content using the TDM tools available in the Lab and finally export the visualisations from the Lab.

  description: "Do you have trouble distinguishing yourself from your peers who have the same name or initials as yourself? Would you like to spend more time doing research and less time managing it? ORCID which stands for Open Researcher and Contributor ID, is a free unique persistent identifier for individuals to use as they engage in research, scholarship, and innovation activities. In this session, Melroy Almeida from the Australian Access Federation will talk about ORCID in context of the research you are doing at your institution. The session will help you understand how to get an ORCID ID, to distinguish yourself from your peers and maximise the benefits you can get from your ORCID record. "

So why do we often hear a little voice telling us that we’re not good enough, that one day we will be found out for the fraud we are, and wondering why you were even given this job in the first place? Imposter syndrome is a psychological occurrence in which people doubt their skills, talents and accomplishments, and it is a lot more common than you think. In this workshop, we will unpack the different types of imposter syndrome and explore strategies to ensure it does not hold you back in your career. "

For some reason, this need for mastery often bleeds into other aspects of our careers. We often feel that if we are not an expert in a particular methodology or approach than it is not ours to use or try. But when it comes to technology, if you don’t allow yourself to be ‘bad at it’, what opportunities or ideas could you be missing out on? Join me in a talk all about how embracing new technology can make you a more creative, collaborative, and successful researcher. "
